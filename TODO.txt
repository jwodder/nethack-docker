- Add `RUN useradd wizard` to the Dockerfiles and require the user to do
  `docker run -u wizard nethack nethack -D` for wizard mode?  (This might mean
  setting the setuid flag again)
- Add older versions?
- Add "onbuild" images that ADD and apply a set of patches?
- Add "full" images that have all experimental/optional features enabled
  (except non-tty windowing systems?)
- Figure out how to get the `latest` and `3.6.0` tags to be the exact same image
- Add an image that builds the absolute latest version from the official Git
  repository <git://git.code.sf.net/p/nethack/NetHack> ?
