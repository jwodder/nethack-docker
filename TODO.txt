- Add `RUN useradd wizard` to the Dockerfiles and require the user to do
  `docker run -u wizard nethack nethack -D` for wizard mode?  (This might mean
  setting the setuid flag again)
- Add branches for older versions?
- Add "onbuild" images that ADD and apply a set of patches?
- Add "full" images that have all experimental/optional features enabled
  (except non-tty windowing systems?)
