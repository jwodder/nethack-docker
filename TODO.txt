- Add the 3.6.0 volumed wrapper script to the 3.4.3 volumed image
- Create a v3.6.0 Dockerfile that uses sysconf
- Add to Docker Hub
- Write a README
 - Topics to cover:
  - Setting your username via $USER
  - Using a .nethackrc file
- Should the Dockerfile set TERM?
- Look into the necessity of making NetHack setuid
- Look into the necessity of enforcing user & group ownership (and permission
  bits?) on the contents of /data
- For the volumed versions: Mess around with various combinations of USER,
  GAMEUID, and HOME
- Delete the non-volumed Dockerfiles?
